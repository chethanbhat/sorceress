It’s no secret that sorcery, or black magic, holds a certain allure for a lot of people. The idea of doing the unthinkable and something that seems completely illogical, and have it actually happen just holds a mystery about it that one must investigate. But sorcery can be a very dangerous practice and one that must only be practiced by sorcerers or sorceresses. As glamorous as sorcery seems and as fun as it is to imagine doing something “creepy” or “spooky”, sorcery can have catastrophic outcomes that could never have been expected by a novice.

Many people, youth in particular, enjoy the idea of conjuring the spirits of friends or family that have passed. The desire to do this may not come from curiosity but simply a strong urge to have one last communication with the dead. They may hold a séance or play with a Ouija Board to get the answers they have been looking for. But while they are only trying to participate in an innocent game of sorts, evil can arise and quickly take control of the situation. Those new to the practice of black magic will not know how to fight back the evil spirits and continue to manage the situation.

Others who may believe that they have a good understanding of sorcery and actually do want to perform rather intense rituals can also do more harm than good. Sorcery is something that must be studied and learned from someone who has much experience in the practice, such as a sorcerer or sorceress. While performing these rituals, an inexperienced person may accidentally cause too much harm and the results can be disastrous. Once again, the person will find themselves deeper into the black magic than intended and will not be able to find a way out.

There are also elements that come with casting spells and evoking spirits that simply comes from practice. A sorceress may know exactly how much of one herb will be ineffective, how much will be too effective, and how much she actually needs. These details may seem quite small but the slightest variation in a ritual can have a completely unexpected result.

It’s important to remember that if you are interested in performing anything that involves black magic, it’s best to leave it to those who have dedicated their lives to it. Although it may not seem that it is something as drastic as sorcery, it’s probable that it is and can be extremely dangerous.
